# Kevin L. Keys 

I am trained in genomic data science and scientific computing. I was previously a postdoctoral scholar at the UCSF School of Medicine and a Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. I completed my dissertation at UCLA under Kenneth Lange.

## Expertise
I have 15+ years of interdisciplinary research experience in statistical genetics, data science for biology, and machine learning methods in genomics.
I am facile with genotype and gene expression analyses, including bulk and single cell, and experienced in multiple other multiomic analyses (methylation, small RNA, ChIP-Seq, metabolomics, etc.).
I offer consulting, analysis, and guidance with a consummate professional attitude.

## Services
