Bioinformatics is not one-size-fits all. First and foremost I am a biologist, which means I can understand your biological question and help you find and implement the correct computational solution suited to your needs.

## Expertise
My specialisation is in RNA biology, human genetics and transposable element biology. I am currently working on intra-species sequence variation of ribosomal RNA, in particular oncogenic ribosomal variants.
